00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:07.080
So today, we are going to talk about,

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.435
er, community detection in networks.

00:00:09.435 --> 00:00:12.420
So basically, what community detection is,

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.120
is essentially clustering a set of nodes,

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.335
uh, in a graph.

00:00:16.335 --> 00:00:18.180
So, uh, this is what we are, uh,

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.585
going to do today and the clustering we are going

00:00:21.585 --> 00:00:24.990
to do will be based on the net structure,

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.790
er, of the network.

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:29.250
So, let's start, uh,

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.360
by defining this pro-, er,

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:35.720
problem of community detection and then I'm going actually to talk to you about-

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:40.380
about some social science research that explains why do we see these,

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:42.180
uh, clusters in networks,

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.605
why do they make sense,

00:00:43.605 --> 00:00:46.805
and they actually inform the development of the methods,

00:00:46.805 --> 00:00:48.320
er, to be able to do this.

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:50.610
So, um, when we write,

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.130
er, or when we draw, er, networks, let's say,

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:55.730
on a- on a piece of paper, we often, er,

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:58.700
would like to think of them to have kind of the following,

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:00.320
uh, the following structure, right?

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.140
We think of them as having these, uh, clusters,

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:08.600
these communities where the- the edges inside the cluster are more,

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.355
um, are more than the edges, er,

00:01:10.355 --> 00:01:13.010
spanning, uh, across, uh, the clusters.

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:16.910
And this is kind of how intuitively we like to think of networks,

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:20.090
in particular social networks perhaps where

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:23.435
these types of clusters could correspond to social communities.

00:01:23.435 --> 00:01:26.200
We think of them in terms of- in biological networks.

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.750
We can think of these as some kind of, uh, functional units,

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.680
modules that are there to do a certain task, um, and so on.

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.460
So, we'd like to think that the networks are not just kind of messy objects,

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.725
but that they have this kind of clustering, uh, org- organization.

00:01:41.725 --> 00:01:43.560
So the question is,

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.900
how did this picture, uh, arise?

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:49.430
What kind of evidence do we have that these types of structure

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:53.200
actually appears in networks and what could be some reasons for it?

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:59.470
So, um, here is one way to think about this from the viewpoint of, er, social networks.

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:02.120
So right now what we'll do is we're going to do a bit of

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:06.320
a dive in into classical social science and classical,

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.245
er, social network analysis.

00:02:08.245 --> 00:02:09.515
So the question is,

00:02:09.515 --> 00:02:12.710
how does information flow through networks?

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:14.360
Think of a social network, right,

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.750
where basically we have people connected in a social network and

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.350
there are different links over which the information flows.

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:24.830
And let's call these links short and long.

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:26.750
Um, and let's call them, you know,

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:31.550
short as the ones that kind of are- are a very kind of, er, local.

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:33.109
These are strong friendships,

00:02:33.109 --> 00:02:36.950
and let's also have these long links that you- which we can think of as

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:40.820
links to our acquaintances and kind of colleagues and people we,

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:42.815
let's say, meet, uh, less often.

00:02:42.815 --> 00:02:45.080
And the way we can think of this is that, you know,

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:47.405
we have these short, er, short, er,

00:02:47.405 --> 00:02:49.505
strong links and we have these weak, er,

00:02:49.505 --> 00:02:51.920
long links, er, to other parts,

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.365
er, of the network.

00:02:53.365 --> 00:02:56.520
So, uh, there was a seminal work, er,

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:00.000
back in 1960s, uh, by Mark Granovetter,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.510
who's a sociologist here at Stanford University,

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:04.070
and this is I think the most,

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:06.380
er, cited and the most impactful,

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:08.675
uh, social science paper ever.

00:03:08.675 --> 00:03:12.320
And this is really about his research during his PhD,

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:13.940
where he was asking about,

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:18.040
how do people find information through personal contacts?

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:21.695
Um, and, um, what- he was looking at this,

00:03:21.695 --> 00:03:23.465
how people find jobs.

00:03:23.465 --> 00:03:29.270
So he was asking people who were on the job market to basically- and have found a job to,

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:31.820
er, to tell him, where did you hear about this job?

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:36.440
Which, er, which person did you tell- tell you about- about this job opening?

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.225
How did you apply, things like that.

00:03:38.225 --> 00:03:41.600
And, uh, what was interesting is that, um,

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:45.410
contacts through which these people heard for job openings and

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:49.050
found jobs were more often acquaintances than,

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:51.000
let's say, close friends, right?

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.150
So it wasn't that you would, uh,

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:55.715
hear that people heard about new job openings

00:03:55.715 --> 00:03:59.030
from people they have very strong relationship with that, you know,

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:00.845
they spend a lot of time together,

00:04:00.845 --> 00:04:04.280
but they heard about new job openings through these,

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:10.710
um, acquaintances, people that would- they would kind of meet less, uh, more rarely.

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:13.220
Um, and this is very surprising because you

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:16.350
would imagine that it is actually your friends,

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:19.070
people you have strong, er, relationships with,

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:22.130
whose- whose best interest is to help you,

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:23.210
who are closest to you,

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:26.435
who are the most motivated to help you find,

00:04:26.435 --> 00:04:28.385
uh, a job, to connect you,

00:04:28.385 --> 00:04:30.250
uh, with the job openings, and so on.

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:32.390
But what turned out was that it was actually

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:36.180
casual acquaintances who- who- through which,

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:37.815
um, through whom, uh,

00:04:37.815 --> 00:04:41.610
the- these job seekers found about, er, new jobs.

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:45.940
So what this means is if we go back to the- to the picture that we had before,

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:47.170
it was that- basically,

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:48.530
it was this- these types of,

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:50.060
let say, acquaintance links,

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:51.470
these weak links, uh,

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:52.965
to- to have, uh,

00:04:52.965 --> 00:04:56.000
to be the ones through which people heard about the jobs and

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.570
not necessarily these kind of strong, uh, interpersonal links.

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:02.330
So this means that acquaintances are more,

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:04.790
uh, were more helpful in this process.

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:06.625
And the question was, why?

00:05:06.625 --> 00:05:13.435
And Granovetter gave these two perspective on a friendship or on a link in the network.

00:05:13.435 --> 00:05:20.015
So the first struct- the- the first perspective on a link in the network is structural.

00:05:20.015 --> 00:05:24.260
It's about, what is the structural role of a link in the network?

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:25.355
So you can think about,

00:05:25.355 --> 00:05:29.690
what is the structural role of a friendship in a social network, right?

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:33.650
We can think about this particular edge being this kind of, um,

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:35.840
connecting different parts of the network,

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:40.070
while this particular other edge being very well embedded,

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:41.600
uh, inside the network, right?

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:45.620
Having all these common friends and being a really strong, uh, relationship.

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:47.735
So that's kind of structural.

00:05:47.735 --> 00:05:51.095
And then there is also the interpersonal, er,

00:05:51.095 --> 00:05:53.420
view which is about, er,

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:56.660
friendships being either kind of strong or weak, right?

00:05:56.660 --> 00:06:00.125
Having a very strong relationship with someone or having a much,

00:06:00.125 --> 00:06:01.910
er, weaker relationship with,

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:03.695
uh, uh, each other.

00:06:03.695 --> 00:06:09.380
And, uh, what Granovetter shows is that structural and interpersonal,

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:11.245
uh, relationship of the link,

00:06:11.245 --> 00:06:13.185
they- they are connected.

00:06:13.185 --> 00:06:15.870
They- they are related to each other.

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:18.075
So, uh, let me explain how.

00:06:18.075 --> 00:06:22.670
So first, uh, point is that Granovetter makes the connection between the

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:27.440
social and the structural role of an edge and shows that they are related,

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:29.320
they are correlated, they are connected.

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:31.950
So first is the structural point, right?

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:35.175
The structural, um, edge from, uh, er,

00:06:35.175 --> 00:06:38.250
from the point of e- edge being in the network, um,

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:41.640
he basically say- shows that structurally embedded edges,

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:43.770
so edges, uh, that,

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:45.825
uh, that happen among co-, er,

00:06:45.825 --> 00:06:48.140
in the- in the densely-linked parts

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:50.615
of the network where there is a lot of common friends,

00:06:50.615 --> 00:06:55.385
that these edges tend to be strong edges like inter-personally strong.

00:06:55.385 --> 00:06:59.855
And that these long-range edges that kind of connect the different parts of the network,

00:06:59.855 --> 00:07:03.135
they tend to be socially weak, right?

00:07:03.135 --> 00:07:05.355
So, um, what does this mean?

00:07:05.355 --> 00:07:07.240
This means that, um,

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:09.380
there is a relationship between the strength of

00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:13.075
the relationship and the structure of the relationship.

00:07:13.075 --> 00:07:16.375
So strength means, uh, strong links, er,

00:07:16.375 --> 00:07:19.100
between people who have a lot of friends in common,

00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:23.450
and weak links connecting different parts of the network, right?

00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:27.800
So weak friendships are ge- generally the ones that

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:32.900
connect different parts of the network and strong friendships are the ones that- that,

00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:34.730
uh, where you have, um,

00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:36.380
a lot of friends in common, and so on.

00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:38.180
And what I want to say is,

00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:41.570
strong friendship is not defined by having a lot of friends in common.

00:07:41.570 --> 00:07:44.280
You can ask someone who are your strongest friends,

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:46.100
and then if you check in the social network,

00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:48.905
you will see these are the people you have a lot of friends in common.

00:07:48.905 --> 00:07:52.430
So these are the structurally strong, uh,

00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:58.080
structurally well embedded relationships are socially strong and structurally,

00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:02.615
um, uh, kind of di- the relationships that connect different parts of the network,

00:08:02.615 --> 00:08:04.210
they are socially weak.

00:08:04.210 --> 00:08:06.530
So those are- those are two connections,

00:08:06.530 --> 00:08:08.480
two important aspects of a relationship.

00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:10.940
So social strength of a relationship and

00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:14.585
a structural role or position of the relationship,

00:08:14.585 --> 00:08:16.030
that's the first point.

00:08:16.030 --> 00:08:18.765
And then, the second important point that

00:08:18.765 --> 00:08:22.120
Granovetter makes is this notion of information flow.

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:25.490
And he says that long-range edges allow you to gather

00:08:25.490 --> 00:08:28.910
information from very different distant parts,

00:08:28.910 --> 00:08:30.205
uh, of the network.

00:08:30.205 --> 00:08:32.570
Uh, and this means that now you have access to

00:08:32.570 --> 00:08:37.430
all these distant information that can come to you and can be very useful to you, right?

00:08:37.430 --> 00:08:40.490
And, er, he says that structurally embedded edges are

00:08:40.490 --> 00:08:44.160
heavily re- redundant in terms of information access, right?

00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:45.570
So if you think that, I don't know,

00:08:45.570 --> 00:08:47.400
this person A is, uh,

00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:51.050
is an edge in the network and they are looking for, er, jobs, yes,

00:08:51.050 --> 00:08:53.810
they have these three strong, uh,

00:08:53.810 --> 00:08:57.050
social relationships with these three- three other people,

00:08:57.050 --> 00:09:00.185
but essentially, these relationships are very redundant, right?

00:09:00.185 --> 00:09:02.915
Whatever, uh, one of these people knows,

00:09:02.915 --> 00:09:05.430
they can either tell them to node A directly,

00:09:05.430 --> 00:09:06.590
or perhaps, you know,

00:09:06.590 --> 00:09:09.110
they are going through casual conversations sa- tell it

00:09:09.110 --> 00:09:11.900
to this other node who's going to tell it to node A.

00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:14.180
So in terms of information access,

00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:16.585
these edges are heavily redundant.

00:09:16.585 --> 00:09:19.220
Well, for example, this weak long-range

00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:22.595
edge to some other part of the network to this node B,

00:09:22.595 --> 00:09:26.045
this is a very useful edge because it gives you access to

00:09:26.045 --> 00:09:30.050
all this information from these other, uh, community.

00:09:30.050 --> 00:09:32.180
So this is the second point,

00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:36.230
is that strongly embedded edges are information redundant and it

00:09:36.230 --> 00:09:40.590
is weak edges that give you access to very dif- distant parts,

00:09:40.590 --> 00:09:41.849
uh, of the relationship,

00:09:41.849 --> 00:09:43.230
uh, of the network.

00:09:43.230 --> 00:09:48.605
Um, and this is important because if you look how social networks evolve, um,

00:09:48.605 --> 00:09:51.365
they evolve such as the communities form,

00:09:51.365 --> 00:09:56.630
in a sense that net- tightly-connected clusters of nodes naturally form.

00:09:56.630 --> 00:09:59.135
And the reason for this is that, um,

00:09:59.135 --> 00:10:02.380
the networks tend to evolve using triadic closure.

00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:03.910
What that means is that,

00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:05.825
if you have two friends in common,

00:10:05.825 --> 00:10:07.400
you know, A has a friend B,

00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:08.975
and A has a friend C,

00:10:08.975 --> 00:10:14.010
then sooner or later A and B are going to meet and they are going to create,

00:10:14.010 --> 00:10:15.640
uh, a link with each other.

00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:18.290
Another important aspect is that we like to

00:10:18.290 --> 00:10:21.130
connect with others that are similar to us, right?

00:10:21.130 --> 00:10:24.260
So if I am, I don't know, a computer scientist,

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:26.870
or maybe I like soccer, football, right?

00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:28.850
Maybe I play football with node B,

00:10:28.850 --> 00:10:31.760
probably I may- play football with node C as well,

00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:34.760
so they already will have something in common so they can,

00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:36.780
uh, form that relationship, right?

00:10:36.780 --> 00:10:38.130
So this is, um,

00:10:38.130 --> 00:10:43.100
an important thing is that because we like to connect to others that are similar to us,

00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:45.485
so if I'm connected to two other people,

00:10:45.485 --> 00:10:47.990
they likely share some similarities,

00:10:47.990 --> 00:10:49.385
some aspects to myself.

00:10:49.385 --> 00:10:53.110
This means that they're alw- also going to share that similarity,

00:10:53.110 --> 00:10:55.345
so they'll be more likely to bond,

00:10:55.345 --> 00:10:57.345
uh, and create, uh, an edge.

00:10:57.345 --> 00:10:58.920
So it means in networks,

00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:00.855
these are the edges that,

00:11:00.855 --> 00:11:03.000
uh, that ha- that like to form.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:04.170
So for example, uh,

00:11:04.170 --> 00:11:06.900
A to B is a likely edge, um, and, you know,

00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:09.810
to- also A to C because there is a fr- a common friend,

00:11:09.810 --> 00:11:11.485
uh, B, uh, in between.

00:11:11.485 --> 00:11:14.075
So these are examples of edges that, uh, uh,

00:11:14.075 --> 00:11:17.690
that are-, uh, happen to in social networks, uh, a lot.

00:11:17.690 --> 00:11:19.790
So now, you know,

00:11:19.790 --> 00:11:23.540
why is- why are some reasons that these types of edges happen?

00:11:23.540 --> 00:11:29.330
Because if you remember early on we were talking about clustering coefficient, right?

00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:32.720
The fraction of your neighbors that are connected with each other.

00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:37.100
And this is essentially a metric of this notion of a triadic closure.

00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:40.340
Because if we have this simple network structure,

00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:42.080
uh, here, uh, on the right,

00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:43.475
then you can say, you know,

00:11:43.475 --> 00:11:46.625
if B and C have a friend A in common,

00:11:46.625 --> 00:11:49.865
so why should B and C link to each other?

00:11:49.865 --> 00:11:52.280
First is, they are more likely to meet each

00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:54.965
other because they have this common friend,

00:11:54.965 --> 00:11:57.710
uh, A, and maybe he invites them both,

00:11:57.710 --> 00:11:59.210
uh, for the coffee or something.

00:11:59.210 --> 00:12:03.260
Second thing is B and C are more likely to trust each other because again,

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:05.840
they have this common friend that they both trust so they say,

00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:07.175
"Oh, you have this guy, uh,

00:12:07.175 --> 00:12:09.320
as a friend, I- I like him,

00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:11.765
you like him, obviously we have something in common."

00:12:11.765 --> 00:12:14.330
And then there is also another important point,

00:12:14.330 --> 00:12:17.060
which is A has incentive to bring,

00:12:17.060 --> 00:12:19.040
uh, B, and C together, right?

00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:20.990
Because from A's point of view,

00:12:20.990 --> 00:12:23.285
it is hard or costly,

00:12:23.285 --> 00:12:26.060
it requires effort to maintain, uh,

00:12:26.060 --> 00:12:28.520
two relationships, uh, together,

00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:31.395
uh, for, uh for, uh, Node A.

00:12:31.395 --> 00:12:33.610
So if there is a triangle,

00:12:33.610 --> 00:12:35.695
so if A links to B, B links to C,

00:12:35.695 --> 00:12:40.080
then all of them basically can go and hang out together because they are all friends.

00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:42.950
So these are reasons for, uh, triadic closure.

00:12:42.950 --> 00:12:45.185
And that is an important aspect,

00:12:45.185 --> 00:12:49.715
is that actually social science research shows that being embedded,

00:12:49.715 --> 00:12:54.215
having a lot of the strong edges and a lot of triangles around you,

00:12:54.215 --> 00:12:56.915
um, is, uh, is, ah, is, ah,

00:12:56.915 --> 00:13:01.040
kind of, um, is- is- is easier, warmer, um,

00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:02.915
it's, ah, this is what,

00:13:02.915 --> 00:13:05.165
ah, what humans, ah, seek for.

00:13:05.165 --> 00:13:06.560
And actually, for example,

00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:08.660
there is a famous study, um,

00:13:08.660 --> 00:13:10.790
of, uh, teenage girls who have,

00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:12.995
for example, low clustering coefficient.

00:13:12.995 --> 00:13:16.370
They are, uh, they are found to more likely contemplate suicide.

00:13:16.370 --> 00:13:21.290
So basically right, it is hard to not have friends who are friends with each other.

00:13:21.290 --> 00:13:24.575
So it's good to be well embedded in social clusters.

00:13:24.575 --> 00:13:26.705
That's kind of the social structures, uh,

00:13:26.705 --> 00:13:28.850
we humans, uh, seek.

00:13:28.850 --> 00:13:31.850
So now, uh, this, uh,

00:13:31.850 --> 00:13:36.500
Granovetter explanation was a theory from the 60's, right?

00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:38.330
Basically what he said was the following.

00:13:38.330 --> 00:13:42.260
He said, edges that are embedded in the network,

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:44.555
so edges that have high clustering coefficient,

00:13:44.555 --> 00:13:46.370
edges that have a lot of,

00:13:46.370 --> 00:13:47.690
uh, friends in common,

00:13:47.690 --> 00:13:49.430
edges that uh, uh,

00:13:49.430 --> 00:13:51.485
appear in dense parts of the network,

00:13:51.485 --> 00:13:54.845
these edges tend to be socially strong.

00:13:54.845 --> 00:13:58.295
And edges that connect distant parts of the network,

00:13:58.295 --> 00:14:00.320
they tend to be socially weak.

00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:03.515
Um, and this is a prediction he made,

00:14:03.515 --> 00:14:05.600
um, based on his research,

00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:08.900
but it was left untested for,

00:14:08.900 --> 00:14:11.269
er, 40 plus years.

00:14:11.269 --> 00:14:15.410
And actually it was only in 2007 that this theory, uh,

00:14:15.410 --> 00:14:21.740
was actually, uh, kind of validated on real large-scale data.

00:14:21.740 --> 00:14:26.345
And the study is based on cell phone,

00:14:26.345 --> 00:14:29.090
uh, data, uh, from one of the European countries.

00:14:29.090 --> 00:14:31.610
So where you say the strength of a relationship,

00:14:31.610 --> 00:14:34.565
strength of an edge will be the number of phone calls,

00:14:34.565 --> 00:14:37.400
um, that- that we make in a given period, right?

00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:40.520
And the idea is that people who are strong friends with you will make

00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:44.195
a lot of phone calls with and people you are more acquaintances with,

00:14:44.195 --> 00:14:46.820
maybe you call them for Christmas, uh, and, you know,

00:14:46.820 --> 00:14:48.620
wish them a Happy New Year, for example,

00:14:48.620 --> 00:14:51.530
that would be, you know, once in a year type of, uh, phone call.

00:14:51.530 --> 00:14:56.165
So the prediction from Granovetter would be that strong edges should be, uh,

00:14:56.165 --> 00:15:01.280
these edges with lots of phone calls should be clustered together in, uh, small pockets,

00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:04.460
and then these edges that, uh, that, uh,

00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:06.440
that span across different parts of the network,

00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:08.465
there the number of,

00:15:08.465 --> 00:15:11.090
uh, um, uh, phone calls, uh, will be smaller.

00:15:11.090 --> 00:15:14.450
That's the prediction. The way- the way, uh,

00:15:14.450 --> 00:15:17.045
this was operationalized was first to say,

00:15:17.045 --> 00:15:18.830
um, the notion of, uh, you know,

00:15:18.830 --> 00:15:23.030
how, uh, how strong or weak is the edge structurally,

00:15:23.030 --> 00:15:26.585
uh, and you quantify this by the metric called edge overlap.

00:15:26.585 --> 00:15:27.725
And simply you ask,

00:15:27.725 --> 00:15:32.840
what is the fraction of neighbors that edge endpoints have in common, right?

00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:34.070
So for example here,

00:15:34.070 --> 00:15:40.760
the edge overlap is 0 because these nodes i and j have no friends in common,

00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:42.080
while here, for example,

00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:46.595
this is an overlap of 1 because they have all these- all these neighbors,

00:15:46.595 --> 00:15:49.640
each of them, and they are both mutually connected to all of them.

00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:53.570
So here we would say this edge is very well embedded, uh,

00:15:53.570 --> 00:15:55.505
it is structurally strong,

00:15:55.505 --> 00:15:58.280
and this edge is structurally weak, right?

00:15:58.280 --> 00:16:02.910
It kind of connects to different parts of the network that don't know each other.

00:16:02.910 --> 00:16:05.095
Right? And then, um,

00:16:05.095 --> 00:16:10.210
what Granovetter would say that when edges have low overlap, the, um,

00:16:10.210 --> 00:16:14.615
the number of phone calls will be very small and when edges have high overlap,

00:16:14.615 --> 00:16:18.845
the number of, uh, phone calls, uh, will be very high.

00:16:18.845 --> 00:16:22.160
Here is now the, uh, the result.

00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:26.540
Uh, this is the edge strength in terms of number of phone calls.

00:16:26.540 --> 00:16:28.865
Uh, and this is the neighborhood overlap.

00:16:28.865 --> 00:16:30.785
Uh, and this is the real data.

00:16:30.785 --> 00:16:34.805
And what you see is that the strong- the more the phone calls,

00:16:34.805 --> 00:16:36.215
the higher the overlap,

00:16:36.215 --> 00:16:38.855
which means that highly used links,

00:16:38.855 --> 00:16:42.110
links where a lot of phone calls happen have high overlap, right?

00:16:42.110 --> 00:16:45.395
So links where there is a high number of,

00:16:45.395 --> 00:16:48.335
uh, phone calls, uh, look like this,

00:16:48.335 --> 00:16:52.280
and links where there is a lower number or phone calls have smaller overlap,

00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:55.280
so they are structurally, uh, like that.

00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:58.490
Um, and then here what, also, uh,

00:16:58.490 --> 00:17:01.310
they show is an example of a null model

00:17:01.310 --> 00:17:04.310
where they would basically keep the network structure the same,

00:17:04.310 --> 00:17:07.250
but randomly reassign the edge strands.

00:17:07.250 --> 00:17:09.005
And then you see that there is no,

00:17:09.005 --> 00:17:10.910
uh, relationship, just two, uh,

00:17:10.910 --> 00:17:12.860
and this is expected and it's just kind

00:17:12.860 --> 00:17:17.060
of a safety check to make sure that this analysis makes sense.

00:17:17.060 --> 00:17:18.935
So what this means is that, you know,

00:17:18.935 --> 00:17:20.165
the bigger the overlap,

00:17:20.165 --> 00:17:22.925
the stronger the edge personally.

00:17:22.925 --> 00:17:26.105
To give you a picture that is even more telling

00:17:26.105 --> 00:17:29.105
is that here is a part of this phone call network.

00:17:29.105 --> 00:17:32.000
And this is the strength of the edge.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.220
Red is very strong and yellow,

00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:37.655
green is- is weak in terms of number of phone calls.

00:17:37.655 --> 00:17:40.565
And what you see is that these red edges

00:17:40.565 --> 00:17:43.850
tend to happen in these kind of small clumps here.

00:17:43.850 --> 00:17:46.040
And you see that these long edges,

00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:47.300
they are mostly yellow,

00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:51.980
which means there is a small number of phone calls that happens over them.

00:17:51.980 --> 00:17:55.100
And just to show you the contrast, now,

00:17:55.100 --> 00:17:57.320
I will show you the picture of the same network,

00:17:57.320 --> 00:17:59.540
but I'm going to randomly shuffle,

00:17:59.540 --> 00:18:02.150
uh, edge strengths across the same structure.

00:18:02.150 --> 00:18:05.255
Um, and what you will see is that now all of a sudden,

00:18:05.255 --> 00:18:07.730
this is how the network, uh, looks like, right?

00:18:07.730 --> 00:18:12.800
So if I randomly assign edge strengths according to the real edge strengths,

00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:15.830
you see how now these long-range- long-range edges,

00:18:15.830 --> 00:18:19.280
all of a sudden start to look, uh, red.

00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:22.640
And why is this? This is the reason because there is a lot of

00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:25.310
edges- strong grid edges hidden in

00:18:25.310 --> 00:18:28.430
these clusters and they jus- you just don't get to see them.

00:18:28.430 --> 00:18:32.030
Uh, and these all these long-range edges, they are all yellow.

00:18:32.030 --> 00:18:34.430
They all have very small numbers or phone calls in them.

00:18:34.430 --> 00:18:38.720
But if you now take these edge strengths and randomly permute them,

00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:41.000
randomly assign them over the edges,

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.265
then this is how the network would look like.

00:18:43.265 --> 00:18:45.230
Like all of a sudden, uh,

00:18:45.230 --> 00:18:47.060
you see that there is actually a lot of long-range,

00:18:47.060 --> 00:18:51.530
er, red edges that we don't- just don't see in, uh, practice.

00:18:51.530 --> 00:18:53.600
So what does this mean?

00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:56.030
Uh, this means that,

00:18:56.030 --> 00:18:58.205
uh, edges that are strong, uh,

00:18:58.205 --> 00:19:02.914
interpersonally appear in clu- in densely knit clusters,

00:19:02.914 --> 00:19:06.590
and edges that are weak connect different parts,

00:19:06.590 --> 00:19:08.210
uh, of the network.

00:19:08.210 --> 00:19:12.335
And, uh, another experiment to validate this is to say,

00:19:12.335 --> 00:19:18.230
what if I take my network and I remove edges one by one, uh, uh,

00:19:18.230 --> 00:19:20.885
by the decreasing, um, sorry,

00:19:20.885 --> 00:19:24.260
by the increasing number of, uh, phone calls, right?

00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:26.720
First I will remove edges with one phone call,

00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:28.700
then two phone calls and so on.

00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:32.795
And then here is how I'm removing edges.

00:19:32.795 --> 00:19:34.250
And here he is, uh,

00:19:34.250 --> 00:19:38.870
how does my network fall apart into different connected components, right?

00:19:38.870 --> 00:19:40.775
So as I'm removing edges,

00:19:40.775 --> 00:19:43.655
the network will start to get disconnected.

00:19:43.655 --> 00:19:49.940
And what you notice is that if I remove uh,

00:19:49.940 --> 00:19:53.750
first the edges that have low number of phone calls,

00:19:53.750 --> 00:20:00.050
the- the network is going to fall apart into multiple disconnected components,

00:20:00.050 --> 00:20:02.300
um, much faster, if I would,

00:20:02.300 --> 00:20:05.660
for example, remove, uh, highly, um, uh,

00:20:05.660 --> 00:20:11.525
edges that are highly used because those edges are embedded in these- in these clusters.

00:20:11.525 --> 00:20:13.265
So even if I remove them,

00:20:13.265 --> 00:20:14.810
I don't disconnect the network.

00:20:14.810 --> 00:20:17.300
But if I disconnect- if I remove these weak edges,

00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:20.510
then the network gets disconnected, uh, faster.

00:20:20.510 --> 00:20:23.095
The largest connected component is smaller,

00:20:23.095 --> 00:20:26.350
so the red line is below, uh, the black line.

00:20:26.350 --> 00:20:29.480
Um, um, an- and then if I do something

00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:33.095
similar according let's say now out to the edge overlap where I say,

00:20:33.095 --> 00:20:36.035
let's remove edges with low overlap first,

00:20:36.035 --> 00:20:41.074
you see how now the largest connected component super quickly, uh, gets destroyed,

00:20:41.074 --> 00:20:44.915
which basically the intuition is that if I remove the slow overlap edges,

00:20:44.915 --> 00:20:48.155
very quickly, uh, I get these separate islands,

00:20:48.155 --> 00:20:50.885
separate disconnected, uh, components.

00:20:50.885 --> 00:20:52.790
So, um, you know,

00:20:52.790 --> 00:20:55.010
why- why did we spend, uh,

00:20:55.010 --> 00:20:57.785
uh, these 20 minutes discussing about all these?

00:20:57.785 --> 00:20:59.630
Like what did we learn?

00:20:59.630 --> 00:21:01.985
What we learned is that

00:21:01.985 --> 00:21:06.770
this conceptual picture of networks that I try to sh- that I show here,

00:21:06.770 --> 00:21:10.340
um, is actually well-grounded in sociological,

00:21:10.340 --> 00:21:12.530
uh, processes and social science.

00:21:12.530 --> 00:21:18.890
What we have also found out is that the interpersonal strength of a relationship and its,

00:21:18.890 --> 00:21:20.900
uh, overlap, it, uh,

00:21:20.900 --> 00:21:22.790
embedding in the network,

00:21:22.790 --> 00:21:25.130
uh, are related, right?

00:21:25.130 --> 00:21:26.915
So we- we showed,

00:21:26.915 --> 00:21:29.420
uh, that these type of, uh,

00:21:29.420 --> 00:21:32.870
nodes, uh, and these types of edges that have high overlap,

00:21:32.870 --> 00:21:35.105
that have a lot of friends in common,

00:21:35.105 --> 00:21:38.660
these tend to be interpersonally strong connections

00:21:38.660 --> 00:21:42.560
and that edges with low overlap or zero overlap,

00:21:42.560 --> 00:21:45.500
that kind of connect different parts of the network,

00:21:45.500 --> 00:21:46.805
they tend to be weak,

00:21:46.805 --> 00:21:48.860
they tend to be, um, you know,

00:21:48.860 --> 00:21:51.755
um, don't have high, uh, strength.

00:21:51.755 --> 00:21:54.335
So, uh, this is now, uh,

00:21:54.335 --> 00:22:00.395
very cool because this intuition can serve us to identify this type of, uh,

00:22:00.395 --> 00:22:03.455
bridge connections and be able to, uh,

00:22:03.455 --> 00:22:05.870
separate and be able to identify,

00:22:05.870 --> 00:22:09.090
uh, the clusters, uh, in the network.
